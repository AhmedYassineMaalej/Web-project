# Best-Deal

Ever find yourself endlessly opening multiple online shops in seperate tabs manually comparing prices and reviews trying to find the best-deal?

That is where Best-Deal website comes in:

Best-Deal website streamlines that process by automatically compiling all information from different shops in order to show you:
- Best prices
- Most positive reviews
- Price Trends across different retailers

## How it works

Best-Deal works like any other online shop, except instead of displaying a single price on the pruduct page, you get an table comparing the product on different shops as well as the ability to redirect to shop of choice to continue your purchase.

Best-Deal periodically scans different websites for the list products (Web-scraping) to update its products registry.
